# 3DIsing-model
3d Ising model of a binary alloy.
Uses a Metropolis algorithms and Monte-Carlo methods to predict a phase transition in a binary alloy as the temperature is raised.
Starts from T=0 when the alloy is perfectly ordered and then the temperature is raised progressively. 
At a critical temperature we expect to see a phase transition from the ordered phase (at low temperature) to a disordered phase (at high temperature).
Ising.f90 is the main program while the other 3 are necessary modules for Ising.f90 to run.
